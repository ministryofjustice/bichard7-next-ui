# bichard7-next-ui

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the requirements:

```shell
npm i --dev
npm run install:assets
```

Then, run the development server:

```shell
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:4080/bichard](http://localhost:4080/bichard) with your browser to see the Bichard7 UI. Database and a valid auth token is required to be able to browse the service locally.

### Running the database, user-service and nginx-auth-proxy

To spin up a local instance of the database, user-service and auth proxy, you can use the following make targets in the [main bichard repo](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/bichard7-next):

```shell
$ cd /path/to/bichard7-next
$ make run-pg && make run-user-service && make run-nginx-auth-proxy
```

Once the dependencies follow the login instruction from the `bichard7-next` repo:

1. Navigate to the User Service at [https://localhost:4443/users/](https://localhost:4443/users/) and sign in:
   > User: <your-madetech-email>, Pass: password
   > **N.B.** You can use the `./scripts/get_2fa_email_link.sh` to quickly grab the one-time email verification link from the user-service container logs.
1. After signing in, you should see the User Service home page. An `.AUTH` cookie is generated for localhost, so now you can access Bichard7 UI on [http://localhost:4080/bichard](http://localhost:4080/bichard)

## Development

| features   | Non-generic components which relate to one or more pages                      |
| pages      | Each top-level next.js page which can be visited                              |
| types      | Shared types for typescripting                                                |
| middleware | Code run by our next.js while rendering our pages                             |
| services   | Data access and transformations                                               |

## Testing

To run the tests, ensure that you have a local postgres instance running (run `make run-pg` from the `bichard7-next` repo),
then run `npm run test`

### Unit Testing

#### Code-based

To run code-based (non-visual, no components get rendered) unit tests, run

```bash
    npm run test:unit
```

#### Visual

We are using [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to develop our UI components in isolation.

If you're already running storybook (`npm run storybook`) locally, run in a seperate terminal

```bash
    npm run test:ui:unit:dev
```

or simply

```bash
    npm run test-storybook
```

For CI or otherwise, run (requires `npx playwright install` to be run first sometimes)

```bash
    npm run test:ui:unit:ci
```

We are using [chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) to help document visual changes when we merge changes to main branch
If you need to do any local storybook componets to chromatic (from your local branch) run

```bash
    npx chromatic --project-token <your-project-toke>
```

By logging into chromatic using the shared MoJ github account, under bichard-next-ui click on `Manage` tab and select `Configure` to find the project token

### Visual Regression (Chromatic) Testing

We run visual regression/snapshot testing against all of our visual components in storybook using Chromatic.

If you have made changes to how components look on your branch, you will need to review these changes in the Chromatic UI (and approve them in order to merge).

### Integration/E2e Testing

#### Integration

Code-based integration tests to be run alongside the bichard7-next `postgres` instance

```bash
    npm run test:integration
```

#### E2E

Browser-based E2E cypress tests to be run alongside the bichard7-next `postgres` instance

```bash
    npm run test:ui:e2e
```
